            Despite their crucial role in feeding millions of Filipinos, farmers in the Philippines face a
            myriad of challenges that threaten their livelihoods and the nation’s food security. As John F.
            Kennedy famously stated, “The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at
            retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways,” highlighting the struggles
            they endure. The issues of climate change, food security, urbanization, and the decreasing number
            of farmers are interrelated and require urgent attention. Addressing these challenges is essential
            not only for the well-being of farmers but also for ensuring a resilient food system in the
            Philippines.
            The agricultural landscape in the Philippines is facing a multitude of challenges that
            threaten both the livelihoods of farmers and the nation’s food security. Climate change has led to
            intensified weather patterns, resulting in unpredictable rainfall and rising temperatures that disrupt
            farming cycles and diminish crop yields. These environmental changes not only threaten
            agricultural productivity but also exacerbate the already precarious livelihoods of many farmers.
            Coupled with this is the pressing issue of food security; many farmers find it difficult to access
            markets and receive fair prices for their produce, leaving communities vulnerable to food
            shortages. Urbanization further complicates the agricultural landscape, as valuable agricultural
            land is increasingly converted for development, displacing farmers and reducing local food
            production capabilities. Additionally, the number of farmers is declining, with younger generations
            gravitating toward urban opportunities, which threatens the sustainability of agriculture and leads
            to a loss of essential traditional farming knowledge. Together, these factors create a complex set
            of challenges that highlight the urgent need for support and innovative solutions within the
            agricultural sector to ensure food security and resilience for future generations.

        <p class="centered-text"><b>The History of Farming in the Philippines</b></p>
        <p class="centered-text">“Mag-tanim ay ‘di biro,” which means "farming is no joke," is a saying that reflects the
            serious nature of farming. Agriculture in the Philippines has a long history, dating back before the
            Spanish colonization. The Banaue Rice Terraces, built by the Ifugaos, show this rich heritage.
            However, despite this history, the Philippines imports a lot of rice, and many farmers tell their
            children to find jobs outside of farming. This trend threatens the future of agriculture.
            Farmers today often struggle to make their voices heard. In the past, the Hacienda Luisita
            Massacre in 2004, where seven farmers were killed, shows just how much they have been bearing.
            Similarly, the Kidapawan Massacre in 2016 revealed how wealthy people often ignore farmers'
            needs and respond with violence.</p>

<p class="centered-text"><b>Current Problems: Climate Change and Food Security</b></p>
<p class="centered-text">As of May 2024, the agricultural sector in the Philippines is suffering due to the El Niño
    weather phenomenon. This drought is affecting many regions and causing severe water shortages,
    poor soil health, and increased pest problems. The Department of Agriculture estimates losses at
    P9.50 billion, with over 20,000 farmers affected.
    </p>
    <p class="centered-text">Many families are struggling, and children are leaving school to help and hopefully recover
        what they have lost from their farms, which is why Save the Children has expressed concern about
        the impact on children’s education and health. Climate change is making things worse, with
        warnings about even more severe effects in the future</p>
        <p class="centered-text">Food security is a big issue, too. A former WWF project manager pointed out that food waste
            is a major contributor to climate change. About 30% of the country’s agricultural produce is wasted
            because of poor supply systems. Many small farmers also lack the skills to store and handle their
            crops properly, making it even harder to move forward.</p>
            <p class="centered-text"><b> Issues and Rural Poverty</b></p>
            <p class="centered-text">Land rights are another major challenge. Some politicians prioritize urban development
                over farming, which hurts farmers. Reports indicate that large companies are taking over
                productive farmland, forcing farmers to leave their homes and fall into poverty.
                </p>
                <p class="centered-text">While urbanization can help the economy, it also leads to less food production and can
                    harm local ecosystems. This situation pushes many farmers to move to cities or even abroad for
                    better job opportunities.</p>
                    <p class="centered-text">Despite farming being an important part of Filipino culture, the number of people working
                        in agriculture is decreasing. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, agriculture is losing
                        the most jobs of any sector, which poses a serious risk to the future of the food industry in the
                        country.
                        </p>       
                        <p class="centered-text"><b>Call to Action</b>
                     </p>
                     <p class="centered-text">These challenges show that Filipino farmers need more support. They need better legal
                        protection and a stronger voice to speak for their rights. Even though they feed millions of people,
                        farmers are still often overlooked and undervalued. We must take action to help them. Farmers
                        need guidance to deal with their problems. Without support, the future of agriculture in the
                        Philippines and the culture it represents could be in danger. Let’s recognize the hard work of
                        farmers and advocate for changes that will improve their lives. Together, we can create a fairer
                        agricultural system that honors those who feed us.</p>
